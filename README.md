# Online Car Booking System

Welcome to the Online Car Booking System. This system aims to provide a convenient way for customers to book test drive slots for cars online, eliminating the hassle of physically visiting showrooms only to find their desired car unavailable.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a smart online car booking system that streamlines the process of booking test drives. By allowing customers to browse available cars and schedule test drives online, we aim to enhance the overall customer experience and optimize showroom resources.

## Features

- **View Available Cars**: Customers can browse through the available cars listed in the showroom.
  
- **Book Test Drive**: Customers can select a car of their choice and schedule a test drive slot conveniently online.
  
- **Customer Data Storage**: The system securely stores customer information in a database for future reference and analysis.

## How It Works

1. **View Available Cars**: Customers visit the online platform and browse the list of cars available for test drives.
  
2. **Select Car and Schedule Test Drive**: Upon finding a desired car, customers select the car and choose a suitable test drive slot from the available options.
  
3. **Provide Customer Information**: Customers enter their personal details required for booking the test drive.
  
4. **Confirmation**: After submitting the booking request, customers receive a confirmation message along with the details of their scheduled test drive.
